# linux-project-biol668
This repository is for uploading my completed Linux project.
This is a completed Bash scripting / Linux project for the BIOL 668 course taught by DSK at San Diego State.

Download the necessary files, as included in this repository.
Follow Harnden_backup.sh for producing a script that creates a directory called "BACKUP_FILES" where you can move an assortment of files you'd like to store there. 

Next, you will make a few directories to prepare your environment for performing command-line tasks with the downloaded data files within the terminal. That is as detailed in Harnden_project_bash.sh. 

Additionally, you'll be prepared to write a bash script that runs within a previously creatd RAW_DATA folder, and analyze a user-inputted fasta file.  

Utilize primer.csv and bigdata.fna.gz for Harnden_project_bash.sh and Harnden_fasta_script.sh exercises, as detailed in these shell scripts.

Ensure that you properly unzip the bigdata.fna.gz file for easy grep access and copying of files within bigdata.fna, so that they are in format with the .fna extension:
>> gunzip bigdata.fna.gz
